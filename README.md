# Wheres William
An Alexa skill that tracks where I am at any given time. The skill can be used to find out where I am, where I'm going to next, and where I was historically. Historical queries can be either for a particular date (e.g. last Tuesday), or for a date range (e.g. last month). See below for a full list of commands.
